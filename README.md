My First Repository

Greetings fellow humans,

This is my first go at creating a Git repository. Not much more to say than that, I guess.

In an earlier life I was a programmer, then a systems analyst, later a consultant and now I'm in SysAdmin and support. Thought it might be nice to dial the clock back and see if I've still got any coding chops left in me.

I'm back. After too long. Which probably says more about me than I'd like ;)
